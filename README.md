# Budgeting Application

The budgeting application will:

* Keep track of expenditures and income
* Keep track of credit
* Keep track of envelope system & warn when low
* Place money into buckets

Currently (as of 22.8.3), I only have the Plaid quickstart installed properly,
which is just a simple showing-how of Plaid's software. I can probably use the code
within to learn a little bit more of how Plaid works and how I can implement it 
into my own web app, for me and Megan to use together for our various accounts

A super great place to look at is [this github repo](https://github.com/ribab/plaid_django_example).
It's a fully working Django backend with Plaid implemented, so it's right up the alley
of which I wish to traverse
