# Budgeting Application

This is a simple app (and server) that lays some framework for a budgeting app. It
uses the Plaid API to handle adding accounts to the application for transaction and
account tracking. It has some functionality to add 'buckets' for saving and spending.
The spending buckets track transactions related to that bucket using Plaid's categories.
There's not much support for saving buckets, but some may be added to manually distribute
funds between savings buckets in the future.
