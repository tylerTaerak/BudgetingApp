# Budgeting Application

The budgeting application will:

* Keep track of expenditures and income
* Keep track of credit
* Keep track of envelope system & warn when low (buckets for checking/spending)
* Place money into buckets (for saving)

This is my next project on the chopping block. I really want to get this done as soon
as I can (maybe just because I really don't like web development). Here are the steps
I need to take in order to complete the project.

#### Using Sandbox Mode

1. ~~Get Plaid Link launching and configured properly~~
2. ~~Using link tokens, get checking and savings account info~~
3. ~~Using link tokens, get credit info~~
4. Develop system for buckets (for savings) and envelopes (for spending)
5. Develop system to display statistics (work with Megan to decide what's useful)

#### Using Development Mode

6. Get working using our own accounts
7. Figure out deployment for local Wi-Fi.
8. Figure out deployment for global networking

COMPLETE!
